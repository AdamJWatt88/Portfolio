# Portfolio Project

## Description

This is my portfolio page. With this project I wanted it to be a playground to try out new technologies.

## Built With

This project was built with Gatsby. I have experience with and have built many projects in React. I do not have any experience with static site generators however. With Gatsby being React based, I figured this would make for a pleasant introduction to static site generators.
