I created a visually appealing and responsive landing page using Bootstrap 5 and a provided design from frontendmentor.io. With my front-end development skills and Bootstrap's components, I optimized the landing page for different devices and effectively showcased the product or service. The project highlights my expertise in front-end development and responsive web design.
