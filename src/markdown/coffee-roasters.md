I built a React-based store front for a mock coffee shop, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy while recreating a provided design. The resulting design includes user-friendly features such as product browsing, ordering, and checkout. With a responsive layout, the project showcases my front-end skills in delivering high-quality solutions.
