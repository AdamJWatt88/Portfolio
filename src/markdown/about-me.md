Hi, I'm Adam and I love creating web content! I have a great deal of experience in React and am proficient in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building websites from scratch and using the latest web technologies to create beautiful and functional user interfaces.

Currently, I am also working with WordPress custom theme development, which has given me a new perspective on creating websites using a content management system. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow as a developer.
